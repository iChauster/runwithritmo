# Run With Ritmo

An app dedicated to Rithvik Reddy, an aspiring developer and overall nice guy

The app is scaffolded with `create-react-app` on the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, NodeJS)

To run the app, `npm install` on the project directory, AND the client directory.

Then, use `npm start`, which concurrently runs both the server and client.

## frontend
The Frontend features a ReactJS x Redux web app, and also an unfinished implementation of the React-Native app. 

So far, I've implemented heat mapping (using Google Maps React), and a profile mode where statistics can be viewed through graphs.

## backend
The backend is a NodeJS server and a MongoDB database. Looking to optimize the schema, which currently holds coordinate points throughout the run (may be inefficient for storing long runs).
